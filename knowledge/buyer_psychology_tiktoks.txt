 Problem Aware Content
Description: This content should highlight a problem the audience is unaware of or misunderstanding. The goal is to make them aware of their emotional symptoms related to a brand or website issue. We’ll challenge misconceptions and explain why their current approach isn't working, or even that the problem they think they have isn’t the actual problem.
Example Script Outlines:
	•	Misconception Reveal "If you're [experiencing symptom] because you're putting time and effort into [activity/effort], but it's not getting you [desired outcome], I bet it's because you're [misconception]. When you try to [attempted solution], all it does is [negative consequence], which leaves you feeling [emotional symptom] and ends up making you [undesirable result]. What you should really be doing is [solution]."
	•	Confronting the Misconception "If you think [misconception] will bring you [desire], I have some bad news, but don't worry, I'll tell you the real way to get [desire]. All doing [misconception] is gets you [symptom/problem]. You need [desire], and how you get that is by doing [solution]."
	•	Emotional Connection with Example "If you're feeling [emotional symptom] by trying to do [misconception], you're probably creating [problem], which is getting you [pain point]. You need [solution] in order to get [desired outcome]. Here's an example of how I did it."

Problem Aware Content Examples (These may not have perfectly followed the outlined structure due to previous lack of clarity, but they help set the tone.)
Example 1: "Let me show you what it looks like when I land on your website..."
	•	LOUD symbolizing large logo "business name"
	•	“You gonna buy my stuff?”
	•	Quiet, symbolizing small logo “business name”
	•	“Giving you the solution to the problems that you're currently experiencing when you land on this page."
	•	“Book a call today to find a solution for you”
	•	"If you cannot meet your customer where they're at when they land on your page, you were never gonna sell your stuff. This is why I always advise people to get a brand strategy, strong brand design, and a strong website design for their business to be completely optimized for sales. And I do all of those things."
Example 2: "The reason that people are not obsessed with your brand like you see in your competitor spaces is because you're not doing this stuff and they are..."
	•	"A lot of you think branding is just visuals—things like your logos, your typefaces or fonts, brand icons, colors, and overall design style. All of these things create something you really need: visual consistency."
	•	"That visual consistency makes it so when people continuously see any part of your brand that's out there—on the internet, in print, on a billboard—it all consistently refers back to your overall brand."
	•	"Next is purpose: who you serve, why you serve them, what you solve, and how you specifically solve it. This is usually what you're missing if you're having trouble attracting an audience that's willing to pay you your prices or even people who don’t know what you’re doing."
	•	"Your brand's purpose is how you get a super aligned audience of people who are really willing to work with you. This is one of the biggest parts of being magnetic."
	•	"Your brand experience is usually how you get people to stay and keep coming back to work with you. This is anything like your website, the process in which they work with you, how much you take care of them, etc."
	•	"And the last thing is longevity. This is how you keep your brand staying relevant and top of mind for people. It's about continual research, competitor research, and staying on top of your audience's evolving needs."
	•	"I teach exactly how to do all of this. My Magnetic Brand members are learning how to develop a brand strategy for themselves that can give them all of that and help them execute it, so people are becoming obsessed with their brand and their brand is becoming truly magnetic."
Example 3: "You don't have a brand strategy, and here's how I can tell..."
	•	"You're posting things like 'three accounting tips to help you prepare for tax season,' and you're doing this as an accountant, trying to get paid for accounting work. But you haven't done any of the work to even help people understand how they identify that they need accounting help in the first place."
	•	"And giving them three free tips isn’t going to help them know that."
	•	"Your brand messaging, which is what this is, has to start with your target audience. And yet a lot of you will only define your target audience as women aged 25 to 45 who live in the Midwest. That's not enough to know how to speak to them on a deeper level."
	•	"You need brand strategy work to figure out how you can position yourself in front of them, as well as additional target audience research to understand what they're thinking, what their desires are, and what problems they're having that you can help solve."
	•	"You need to get a brand strategy."

Agitation Content
Description: Agitation content aims to stir frustration and highlight the consequences of not addressing the real problem. It should further irritate viewers by emphasizing that their current actions will only perpetuate negative emotions or lead to undesirable outcomes. The tone should be blunt and confrontational.
